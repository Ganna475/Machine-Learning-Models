ML of Cognorise Internship
This repository showcases a collection of machine learning projects that apply data-driven techniques to solve real-world problems across healthcare and economics.
Each project demonstrates the full workflow — from data preprocessing and visualization to model building, evaluation, and interpretation.

 Overview

The goal of this repository is to present how various supervised learning algorithms can be used to make accurate predictions and uncover insights from data.
By experimenting with different datasets and methods, this collection highlights the strengths and limitations of commonly used ML models.
